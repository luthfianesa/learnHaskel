{- 
 - Haskell is a 'pure functional' programming language
 - Anything we would do must be calling a function
 - That's make haskell different than imperative programming language such as C, C++ or Java,
 - In imperative language we solve a problem by telling the computer the instructions sequence to be executed
 - Meanwhile haskell using pure functional approach, we don't need to tell the computer (how) to solve something  but we just need to tell (what) something to be processed
 - Variabel in haskell is immutable
 - Technically, no 'Variabel' concept in haskell
 - if we redeclare like this :
   score = 5
   score = 10
   This will be resulted an error ("Multiple declarations of score")
   - There is no 'side-effects' in haskel, that means it count something and return it as a result
   - If we call sqrt(16.0) many times, we always got the same result 4.0
